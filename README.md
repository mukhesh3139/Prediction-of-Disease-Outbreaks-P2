Disease outbreaks can be predicted using a variety of data sources, including satellite imagery, social media, and genomic data. These predictions can help public health officials take action to stop outbreaks before they start. 
Data sources 
Satellite imagery: Can provide information on environmental factors that affect health, such as mosquito breeding sites
Social media: Can provide information on public sentiment and emerging health trends
Travel and mobility data: Can provide information on population movement patterns
Genomic and pathogen data: Can provide information on pathogen virulence, drug resistance, and transmission dynamics
Predictive models
Epidemic Intelligence Systems (EIS): Can monitor for disease outbreaks and predict their spread 
Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models: Can handle large amounts of data and understand hidden connections between input features 
Computer algorithms: Can compare traits of known disease carriers with species that are not yet known to carry disease 
Benefits of disease outbreak prediction 
Can help save lives
Can help communities and public health officials take action to lessen disease risk
Can help guide disease surveillance efforts for vulnerable communities
Can enable more targeted, timely interventions and risk communication
